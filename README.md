# code-challenge-1
This project is about a three code challenges which solve problems on grading marks, calculating taxes and processing speed of vehicles.
# project description
The project contains three code challenges.
The first code challenge is used to generate grades for students marks in mainly involves use of if statements.This the criteria used A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

The second code challenge is used to detect the speed of a vehicle and register whether the rules are being followed and issues warning or punishments for those not following rules.If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

The last code challenge is used calculate the net salary of an employee by calculating the taxes and tax reliefs .The taxes are subtracted from the gross salary which includes the  basic salary and benefits.
